<h1>Welcome to Fabb</h1>
<h4>A simple sandbox for getting things done.</h4>
<hr/>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>There are times when you need to get an app concept out of your head and on the screen. You can't afford to get bogged down with complex architectures, build &amp; deployment processes and package managers. You need to spin up an app sandbox fast, with minimal code, out-of-the-box styling, basic authentication and realtime database storage.</p>
<p>Fabb's project template gives you this with Bootstrap 3.0, AngularJS and Firebase, with the right integrations, all over CDN. It contains only a handful of files and couple hundred lines of HTML and Javascript. And because it's a 100% client-side SPA, you don't need any server technology, and you can deploy to a static hosting site such as Brace.io, which offers Dropbox support for the simplest drag-and-drop launch process possible.</p>
<h2>But will it scale?</h2>
<p>Probably not. But since it's built on popular frameworks, you can always take your app to the next level, add a backend and testing environment, replace your Bootswatch with a custom SASS build, or move to an enterprise hosting provider. There's really not any "Fabb code" to get stuck in. It's not a plaform. It's just and pre-packaged assembly of popular libraries, streamlined for kickstarting your next app idea.</p>
